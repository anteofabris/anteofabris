Tucson, AZ

I’m a business intelligence developer at Yale New Haven Health Systems with over four years of experience optimizing operations for healthcare teams. I focus on modernizing legacy systems, integrating APIs into company infrastructure, and shipping reliable, scalable tools in a regulated environment.

I work primarily with TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo, MSSQL, SQL, and PowerShell.

I’m Swiss-American, I have a Masters degree in music composition, I'm a jazz drummer in my free time, and I love to travel.
